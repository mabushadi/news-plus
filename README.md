news-plus
=========

A simple yet powerful angular based news reader connecting various news rss feeds to additional data sources like weather and eventually wikipedia and others. Essentially this is a sample demo of how angular can be used in a mashup style single page application.

It uses <a href="https://developer.yahoo.com/yql/">YQL</a> to integrate services like news and weather into one. 

The user interface uses semantic ui, an amazing clean css layout library.
